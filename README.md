# omnext-datascript-example
An example of how I use datascript with om.next (alpha1)

## Status
It's not much more than the datascript integration page on omcljs/om's wiki.

I may include more stuff as I spend more time with both om and datascript.

## Features

- Nesting components
- Updating entities

## Usage
Run: `lein run -m clojure.main script/figwheel.clj`

Open browser at: `localhost:3449/index.html`
