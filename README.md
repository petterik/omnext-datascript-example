# omnext-datascript-example
An example of how I use datascript with om.next (alpha1)

## Status
Has a bit more stuff than the datascript integration page on omcljs/om's wiki.
Currently not very DRY (code duplication).

I may include more stuff as I spend more time with both om and datascript.

## Features

- Nesting components
- Updating entities
- Different controls for the same data

## Usage
Run: `lein run -m clojure.main script/figwheel.clj`

Open browser at: `localhost:3449/index.html`
